# Card Game Project

This card game project is developed as part of an academic assignment at our school. The game draws inspiration from the classic rock, paper, and scissors game. It consists of three rounds, and the player must successfully navigate all three rounds to determine the final result or winner. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible across the three rounds.

## How to Play

1. Enter your name before starting the game.
2. Choose your preferred menu option from the display.
3. Input your card choice, and the robot will automatically select its card.
4. Both cards will be displayed at the bottom of the console for easy reference.
